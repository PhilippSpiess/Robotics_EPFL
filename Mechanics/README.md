# Mechanical Design

In the second year of Bachelor, with three other students, we designed a « Tilt
chopping mechanism » which could comply with the requirements of the "second mirror" of the Stratosp
heric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) of the Boeing 747SP aircraft operated and maintained by NASA.
The project involved a mobility analysis, dimensions & materials choices, cinematic & dynamic analysis and the use of rece
nt technologies like flexible guidances.
