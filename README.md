# Robotics

Below are the robotic projects I have been working on during my Master at EPFL.

## Electronics

Infrared remote controller using electronic components such as transistors, diodes, amplifiers, timers, resistors, capacitors and inductors to allow detection within a 3 meter range.

## Conception de Mécanisme (Mechanical design)

In the second year of Bachelor, with three other students, we designed a « Tilt chopping mechanism » for a real life problem from the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) of the Boeing 747SP aircraft operated and maintained by NASA. The project involved a mobility analysis, dimensions & materials choices, cinematic & dynamic analysis as well including recent technologies like flexible guidances. Every details had to be in alignment with the specifications from NASA.

## Microrobotics

Epuck robot programmed in C++ to follow a sound source and avoid obstacles. The project involved sound processing using FFT, motor control with a PID controller, proximity sensor signal processing. 

## Model Predictive Control

In a team of three, we implemented model predictive control in Matlab to simulate a quadcopter with non-linear dynamics tracking a references and successfully rejecting noise. The first part of the project involved modelling quadcopter dynamics. Then the invariant sets were computed to optimize the control using MPC. 

## Labs

- Haptics
- Artificial Muscles
- Control of the Micro Delta Direct Drive robot
- Industrial SCARA Robot Adept
- Application of Bayes filters to mobile robot localization
- Programming and characterization of a modular lamprey robot


## Body-robot Control (Semester project at LIS)

For my semester project, I studied how people intuitively control robots using their body. First, I developed two simulators in UNITY-3D and programed a rover and a quadcopter trajectory. I then asked 15 people to experiment the simulators to see how they would imitate the robots. Gigabytes of time series Data was collected using a motion capture system and then processed with Python.
Using a correlation analysis and PCA, I was able to select relevant body parts involved in robot control.
